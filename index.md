# About Me
I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk), under the supervision of [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/) and [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/).  Before that, I obtained my B.Sci. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm) with an outstanding student honor. My major research interest lies in the intersection of *natural language generation* and *social media analysis*, as well as the *vision-language understanding*. See my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iyxbtcEAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details.

I will enter the job market soon. If you are interested in my background, please contact me: [yuewang AT cse DOT cuhk DOT edu DOT hk](mailto:yuewang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk).
